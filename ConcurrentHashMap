-----------------------ConcurrentHashMap in java-----------------------
Prerequisites:Need of ConcurrentMap
ConcurrentHashMap ConcurrentHashMap class is introduced in JDK 1.5, which implements ConcurrentMap as well as Serializable interface also. ConcureentHashMap is enhancement of HashMap as we know that while dealing with Threads in our application HashMap is not a good choice because performance wise HashMap is not upto the mark.

Key points of ConcurrentHashMap:
> The underlined data structure for ConcurrentHashMap is Hashtable.
> ConcurrentHashMap class is thread-safe i.e. multiple thread can operate on a single object without any complications.
> At a time any number of threads are applicable for read operation without locking the ConcurrentHashMap object which is not there in HashMap.
> In ConcurrentHashMap, the Object is divided into number of segments according to the concurrency level.
> Default concurrency-level of ConcurrentHashMap is 16.
> In ConcurrentHashMap, at a time any number of threads can perform retrieval operation but for updation in object, thread must lock the particular segment in which thread want to operate.This type of locking mechanism is known as Segment locking or bucket locking.Hence at a time 16 updation operations can be performed by threads.
  null insertion is not possible in ConcurrentHashMap as key or value.

Constructors of ConcurrentHashMap:
> ConcurrentHashMap m=new ConcurrentHashMap();:Creates a new, empty map with a default initial capacity (16), load factor (0.75) and concurrencyLevel (16).
> ConcurrentHashMap m=new ConcurrentHashMap(int initialCapacity);:Creates a new, empty map with the specified initial capacity, and with default load factor (0.75) and concurrencyLevel (16).
> ConcurrentHashMap m=new ConcurrentHashMap(int initialCapacity, float loadFactor);:
> Creates a new, empty map with the specified initial capacity and load factor and with the default concurrencyLevel (16).
> ConcurrentHashMap m=new ConcurrentHashMap(int initialCapacity, float loadFactor, int concurrencyLevel);:Creates a new, empty map with the specified initial capacity, load factor and concurrency level.
> ConcurrentHashMap m=new ConcurrentHashMap(Map m);:Creates a new map with the same mappings as the given map.
